## Instructions
This program can be run from the command line with "npm start" once its dependencies are installed with "npm i".

## Usage

If, for whatever reason, you'd like to change something about this project, please contact me at my email below or fork the project on GitHub.

## Tests
There's not much in the way of testing that's necessary, but there is the possibility for errors with the towing function, since none of the prompts use inquirer's built-in validate() function.
